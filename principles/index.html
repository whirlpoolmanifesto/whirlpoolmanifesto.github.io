After all, some people will work for as little as shiny stars on a website - so click the thumbs up, throw some high fives, and don&rsquo;t forget to pay well.</li><li>Understand your data.

Good design and architecture pays dividends.</li><li>Most projects will benefit from a benevolent dictator, but don&rsquo;t be afraid to fork them.</li><li>Adaptation is natural - embrace change. Never stop learning and always refine your work when time permits.</li><li>Embrace the outliers; the deviators; the delinquents. They are the keys to success - but you&rsquo;ll have to find the right keyhole.</li><li>Leverage the larger software ecosystem as much as possible, but remember to be eco-friendly - give back, be sustainable.</li></ol></section></article></main><script src=/assets/js/scripts.min.js></script><script type=application/javascript>var doNotTrack=false;if(!doNotTrack){window.ga=window.ga||function(){(ga.q=ga.q||[]).push(arguments)};ga.l=+new Date;ga('create','G-EEG1ZZMVNB','auto');ga('send','pageview');}</script><script async src=https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js></script></body></html>
