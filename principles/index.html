After all, some people will work for shiny stars on a website. However, reward should be in proportion to input, and generosity not lost to greed.</li><li>Understand your data model. Keep it clean and maintain it well.</li><li>Delivering requirements pays bills. Good design and architecture pays dividends.</li><li>Most software projects will benefit from a benevolent dictator, but if they stop delivering value, don&rsquo;t be afraid to fork them.</li><li>Adaptation is natural - embrace change. Never stop learning and refine your work when time permits.</li><li>Embrace the outliers; the deviators; the delinquents. They are the keys to success - but you&rsquo;ll have to find the right doors to open.</li><li>Leverage the larger software ecosystem as much as possible, but remember to be eco-friendly - give back, be sustainable.</li><li>Understand that code reviews are about reviewing <em>the code</em>, not <em>the individual</em>. Criticism should be looked at as an opportunity for improvement.</li></ol></section></article></main><script src=/assets/js/scripts.min.js></script><script type=application/javascript>var doNotTrack=false;if(!doNotTrack){window.ga=window.ga||function(){(ga.q=ga.q||[]).push(arguments)};ga.l=+new Date;ga('create','UA-31423147-2','auto');ga('send','pageview');}</script><script async src=https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js></script></body></html>
